            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, create the pepper base. Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, and scotch bonnet peppers until smooth.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Add one chopped onion and fry until translucent. Stir in the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Pour the blended pepper mix into the pot. Add the curry powder, dried thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Allow it to cook for about 15 minutes, until the stew has reduced and the oil begins to rise to the top.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken/beef stock and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the washed rice to the pot. Stir well to combine, ensuring the rice is fully submerged. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for 30 minutes. <u>Do not open the lid during this time.</u></li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, open the pot and add the remaining chopped onion. Stir the rice from the bottom up. Cover and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the rice is tender.</li>
                <li>Take off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>Chef's Notes & Tips</h2>
            <p>
                For that authentic smoky flavor (Party Jollof), let the rice burn a little at the bottom. The key is to <mark>not stir the rice too often</mark> while it's cooking. This allows the bottom layer to slightly char and infuse the entire pot with a smoky aroma.
